Robin Korkor – A Tiny Cosmic Portfolio

Welcome to my little corner of the universe!
This website is my UX/UI portfolio — but also a place where I got to play, experiment, and make the web feel just a little more magical.

If you see stars drifting, glowing buttons, or a menu that feels like it belongs in a space station…
yeah, I had fun.

What This Project Is:

This is a fully custom website built with:

HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

An animated starry-night background

Responsive design for desktop, tablet, phone, maybe even a fridge

A language switcher (NL / EN / FR)

A smooth mobile menu that opens like a tiny cosmic portal

Project pages, a portfolio overview, and a contact page

Everything is handmade — from the glowing gradients to the motion.

Did I Use AI?

Yep. Absolutely. And it was fun.

AI helped me with:

trying out ideas

refining animations

watching my code go from “eh” to “ooooh”

making the mobile menu less tragic

and experimenting way faster

But every choice, visual, interaction, and weird cosmic vibe?
That was me.
AI was more like a friendly co-pilot holding the flashlight while I built the ship.

What I Learned

This project taught me (in the best way possible):

how to animate a whole galaxy

how to keep pages consistent without losing my mind

how responsive design works on pretty much everything

how to structure a multi-page project

and how fun it is to make a portfolio that actually feels like me

 Final Words

This was honestly a super fun build — part learning, part experimentation, part “what if I make this glow more?”
I’ll keep updating it as I grow as a designer, but for now…

Enjoy floating through my little universe
